# AES test

## What is this?
I want to know

- Can AES be parallelised
- Can AES be parallelised on a GPU
- If you parallelise AES on a GPU, would it be faster and scale better than if you ran it on a single CPU core
- How much faster is it to execute AES in parallel on a GPU in comparison to running it on a single CPU core

Of course the answers to all of these questions are simple:
- yes
- probably
- yes
- a lot

but words are cheap and I want code and results. Also coding AES probably makes for a good intellectual exercise.

## Can I actually use any of this for security critical work?
No. That would be really stupid.
